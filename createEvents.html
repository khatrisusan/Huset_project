            Each year, Huset presents around 1500 events organized by and with hundreds of volunteer enthusiasts and cultural entrepreneurs. Huset is a platform for co-creation, volunteering and cultural entrepreneurship. We work daily to develop fun ideas for alternative and unique experiences in the collaboration with different partners. We are very much in favor of co-creation, as it is our experience that something very special arises when involving more parties to create new ideas and solutions.</p>
